      <h3>The Original Lucky Bill | Garapan, Saipan</h3>
      <img src="images/place.webp" alt="The Original Lucky Bill Place">
      <p>The Original Lucky Bill has American and Thai cuisines. What I liked about the restaurant is how friendly they were and how cozy the place was that it felt like home. I liked their side dishes, specifically somtam which is a papaya salad where you can adjust the spice level (Thai are known for how spicy their foods are), I also liked their fried rice and other authentic thai dishes.</p>
      <h4>What I love:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Their Friendly services</li>
        <li>Their Delicious Side Dishes</li>
        <li>Their Cozy Atmosphere</li>
